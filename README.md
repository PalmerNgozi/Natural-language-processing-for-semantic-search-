Natural Language Processing For Semantic Search

Computers do not understand text like we do. They have their own language, in 

order for the computer to understand what we are saying we need to find a way to 

convert out text into readable computer formats.

This article hopes to answer the following questions

    1. Why should we represent text in vector formats

    2. sparse vectors Versus dense vectors.

    3. How to generate dense vectors

 

Our natural language is full of different information, depending on our moods, a sentence may mean different things, that is why we need a large amount of data to represent a small amount of text. Vectors are what we use for this kind of job, they are naturally good at it.

 

We can represent the vectors in two ways, sparse or dense. 

 Sparse vectors are used when we want to perform syntax based comparison between the data. By syntax we mean word. Locally that would mean we want to check if a group of sentences comprises of the same words, regardless of the meaning. Lets consider this example;

    The ball is running towards our opponent 

    Our opponent is running towards the ball 

They mean different things however they are composed of the same words. 

Dense vectors on the other hand is used when we want to understand the semantic of the various text. By semantic we mean the meaning of the various text. So we will be performing similarities between the meaning of a group of text and not just the similarity in the words used. 

 

We can generate dense vectors as thus;

    1. Sentence transformers 

     2. Dense passage retrieval

    3. Vision transformersS
